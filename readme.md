# C/C++ Stress Testing ( for competitive programming )
>An easy script to check whether your codes produce an exact answer or not

## Warning :
1. For windows ONLY

2. Make sure you've installed MinGW and created a PATH system variable (watch video on youtube)

3. Make sure your codes correct 100% (must be complied)

4. Because of generating random tests, it not always detects bugs

## How to use :
**Step 1 :** Download the file [here](https://codeload.github.com/ryanIsMe/C_Stress_Testing/zip/master "here") 

**Step 2 :** Copy your code and put into *my_code.cpp*

**Step 3 :** Write a brute force code or just simply copy an accepted code from the coding platform where you are using and copy into *accepted_code.cpp*

**Step 4 :** Write a generated code and copy into *generate_code.cpp*

**Step 5 :**  Run *run.bat*

Your output is in *my_code.out*, the test case is in *inp.in* and the output of *accepted_code.cpp* is in *accepted_code.out*
